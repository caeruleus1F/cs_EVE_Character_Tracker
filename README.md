# cs_EVE_Character_Tracker

Tracks the skill training status and wallet balance of three characters in EVE Online.

Originally, this program was written in Visual Basic. Going through the old code, there were a few "what was I thinking" moments. Really I should remove all the VB projects I have on here and maybe port them if they're worth saving.
